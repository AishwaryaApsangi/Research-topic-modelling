1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.340
Amanda Sargent: You should get a message that says we're recording.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.200
Bodhi: Got it.

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:14.700
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Okay, so thank you again. So much for taking the time to meet with me today to get started. Can you just confirm on the record that you're a speaking with me voluntarily.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.930
Bodhi: I am.

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.589
Amanda Sargent: Great and that you've provided consent to be recorded and have your responses included in this research.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.610
Bodhi: Yep, I have.

7
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:31.040
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Okay, so tell us a little bit about yourself, and why you decided to speak with us about this topic of sponsorship.

8
00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:34.199
Bodhi: I think it boils down to the benefits that I've received at work from being sponsored and taking on such a massive endeavor as an executive PhD. I wanted to be able to share insights, benefits, and ways of navigating to get that support because I think that support is paramount to the success of any candidate that goes into an executive PhD program.

16
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:11.389
Amanda Sargent: Okay, and do you? Are you gonna be able to speak at all to also how any sponsorship may have occurred for your professional life, not just your academic life.

17
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.159
Bodhi: Sure, absolutely. I think it starts there. Yeah, I think it really.

18
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.979
Amanda Sargent: Perfect.

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.190
Bodhi: Yeah, I think it really starts with—for those that are trying to balance an academic and workplace pursuit, it really starts with getting that support in the work environment. So I've been very fortunate to be exposed to a great number of things, and certainly, I think part of where I sit in the organization has helped. But getting that executive sponsorship and belief that not only can you do it, but that it’s a worthwhile endeavor for you personally and for your impact on the organization—that’s been essential to my success, right through the ups and through the downs.

26
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.432
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Okay. So, as we discussed in our screening process, we're hoping to get a little insight into how contemporary workers in high-level positions understand and have experienced sponsorship. How would you define sponsorship in your own words?

28
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.370
Bodhi: You know, most simply, probably belief in an individual. But expanding upon that, I mean, sponsorship is multifaceted, right? It is a recognition from those in senior leadership positions above you that you have the talent, the mindset, and the capability to balance both. Sponsorship is also that they see a developing capability in you, right? So they believe that by doing this, you're going to enhance the offering that you bring to the organization. I think there's also an element of sponsorship that has to do with influence. It’s a belief that the influence and insights that you're going to develop and glean as part of the program are going to benefit the broader organization. I think there's also an element of sponsorship that has to do with influence. Right? It is a belief that the influence and insights that you're going to develop and glean as part of the program are going to benefit the broader organization.

36
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.309
Amanda Sargent: Okay, thank you. So do you think that sponsorship and mentorship are the same thing or different things?

38
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.919
Bodhi: I think they can be the same, but many times they are. They take on different flavors. Okay, can you explain that.

40
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.000
Amanda Sargent: A little. Yeah.

41
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.029
Bodhi: Sure. So sponsorship is, let’s say, at the highest level, at the executive suite—not necessarily having a close relationship with the individual but knowing enough about them to know that we want to sponsor them. Right? So if they need help, be it financial, work-life support, we're there because we have a belief in that individual and their trajectory in our organization. I think mentorship can be associated with sponsorship, but mentorship is a little bit more personal. Right? Mentorship is someone who is there to mentor you, to help you whenever you need, to make sure that you're navigating both the work and academic experience successfully. So while they can be the same, I think there is often a distinction. I don't think you can have one without the other. Can you have both at the same time? Sure.

49
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:30.289
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Thank you. So for the purposes of this research, we're broadly defining sponsorship as concrete actions that are taken by one individual aimed at, or important to advancing another individual's career. So we'd love to hear a little bit about your specific experiences with sponsorship. So being sponsored. So if you would just take a moment and think about an example of a time when you experienced or received sponsorship from someone else, and that can be someone inside of your organization or outside of your organization or career field. I'm gonna ask a couple of clarifying questions about that. And then I'm gonna ask you to tell that story, so I'll give you just a moment. You'd let me know when you've got something in mind.

51
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.030
Bodhi: Yeah, I'm I'm comfortable to afford. Sure.

52
00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.790
Amanda Sargent: Good. Okay, so what kind of organization were you working for in terms of industry and size at the time you were sponsored.

53
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.430
Bodhi: Sure I'll use my current example. So we are in the healthcare industry. What were the other 2 questions I'm sorry to to ask.

56
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.520
Amanda Sargent: Just industry, size, and type of industry.

57
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.010
Bodhi: Sure. So healthcare, right healthcare services. I work in the finance arm of that industry in our company. We're a very large fortune. 6.

60
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.690
Amanda Sargent: Gotcha. And what was your title at the time you received the sponsorship.

62
00:05:34.923 --> 00:05:36.290
Bodhi: Executive Director of Expense Management and Strategy. 

64
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.608
Amanda Sargent: Okay, it's a long title. Okay? And how approximately, how old were you.

66
00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:48.440
Bodhi: To receive the sponsorship or the title.

67
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.410
Amanda Sargent: When you, when you received the sponsorship.

68
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.450
Bodhi: 42.

69
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.540
Amanda Sargent: Okay. And where were you in your career? Would you say you were closer to the beginning, the middle, later middle. About where in your career trajectory? Would you say you landed.

71
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.600
Bodhi: I I mean aspirationally, if I wanted to retire, I'm at the end of my career. But quite honestly, where I stand right now I would say, yeah, in this, in the early second half.

74
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.709
Amanda Sargent: Okay. And when you receive the sponsorship, where would you say? Compared to now?

75
00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:25.660
Bodhi: I would say right at the midpoint. Right? Okay, everything's great.

77
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:36.659
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. So how did you perceive your sponsors, gender, race, and social class to be? What was what would you say? Their gender was.

78
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.670
Bodhi: Female.

79
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.410
Amanda Sargent: Okay, their racial identity.

80
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.790
Bodhi: I would say white.

81
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.670
Amanda Sargent: Social class, working class, middle class, upper class.

82
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.439
Bodhi: I would say upper class with roots and.

84
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.310
Amanda Sargent: And appro, okay, and approximately, what age were they.

85
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.300
Bodhi: Aye. Early to mid-fifties. Good. Okay.

88
00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:08.569
Amanda Sargent: And then, who was the person who provided sponsorship to you? What was their relationship to you, and what was their position in the organization.

89
00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:11.880
Bodhi: They are the head of enterprise planning. Someone I had known and worked with tangentially for years. A few years ago, they caught wind that I was looking to exit the organization and take a different opportunity outside and said, “No, come work for me.” 

94
00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:39.759
Amanda Sargent: Okay. So this person was in in the terms of the hierarchy of the organization, a higher position than you were currently.

95
00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:42.149
Bodhi: Instill it. Yup!

96
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:48.758
Amanda Sargent: Great. Okay. So tell us the story. Tell us about what happened. How did they sponsor you? What kinds of actions did they provide.

97
00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:57.629
Bodhi: Sure. And in terms of the program. It was a conversation that I'd had with them, and and a couple of other individuals about a want to come back to to to Bentley and Bro. There are a lot of questions about, you know. Why are you able to manage this. How do you think this is going to impact yourself? How do I think it's going to impact the organization? And and as we started to have a frank conversation about that, it grew into “Yes, you’re doing this. How can I help?” and what was great was through the application process. I think there was a need for 2 letters of recommendation. There was certainly follow up, and those I still have not seen them. I have heard about them. I don't know if I do ever want to see them, as it may invoke a number of emotions that I don't necessarily want to have on camera. But it was certainly something that gave me a sense of not not necessarily belonging, but a belief in me. Which is really important, as you look to sponsorship and moving forward, that someone not only believes in you, but is willing to publicly unbelief you and sponsor you to move forward.

112
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.550
Amanda Sargent: So just to clarify, this was a person in your organization who actively pushed supported promoted you to be able to take on this additional educational opportunity.

114
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.720
Bodhi: That's right, Yup, and did not take, and and knew that the balance was not going to detract from my career aspirations.

116
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.860
Amanda Sargent: Right.

117
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.409
Bodhi: It wasn't a give and take it was a we're going to help you through this.

119
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.910
Amanda Sargent: Amazing, amazing. So in your opinion, then, what do you think the most important career related outcomes were that resulted from this sponsorship.

121
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.780
Bodhi: In in terms of of for me.

122
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.139
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, for you.

123
00:09:45.739 --> 00:09:54.309
Bodhi: I think it was, was a recognition that there is more that I can do more than I can that I can give, but having a background on leadership and the diverse aspects that go into leadership, especially as it pertains to research. Or something, I I think, was, was at the forefront.

128
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:16.869
Amanda Sargent: Hmm, okay. And then, were there any personal outcomes that you experienced? Positive negative neutral as a result of the sponsorship.

129
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.200
Bodhi: Nothing negative. I think it was more about how sponsorship helped reinforce a sense of belief beyond just self-belief. It was knowing that someone else in my workplace environment as much, if not more, than I do.

132
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.990
Amanda Sargent: And why do you think this particular person decided to sponsor you in this way?

133
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.829
Bodhi: If I had to guess. There are elements in our organization where I don't necessarily fit the standard, so I do not have a standard accounting background. Right? My background is reverse. It spans architecture and accounting and finance and management reporting and integrations and trans in transformation type work. So I think part of that was the recognition that this diverse background that I have can continue to be enhanced with a business leadership Phd program that that adds to that. And then the flip side of that is, it allows me and others to prom push that mindset that background, those behaviors across the organizations that we we stopped being single threaded. Right, we stopped viewing what we do as a 360 approach, but more spherical nature right thinking left, right front, back, up, down, forward, backwards. I think that mindset and that that developing mindset at least that that I have that's being enhanced through the program is going to help to reshape and and and rewrite our DNA as we start to do bigger and better things in the organization.

157
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.369
Amanda Sargent: Oh, yeah, that's big. That's really big. I love how you described that, too, that sort of spherical thinking. Because I think in organizations. Many times we have like this is the position, and this is the cookie cutter description of who can fit in this. And they have to have just these 3 things, and if they do anything that's not that, then they don't fit right? But it sounds like what you're saying is that this person encouraging you in this way, and actually actively advocating for you, as sort of also shown other people. Maybe in the organization that like that's maybe not the best way to go like we need to use, like the diversity within our individuals, including their diversity of skill, set and talent and and honor that, and see how that can be leveraged, and sort of using that to even create a sort of different culture. Does that feel accurate? I love it.

163
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.519
Bodhi: It absolutely does. And and you know, culture and a collaborative, trustful culture is contagious.

167
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.700
Amanda Sargent: hmm! I agree. So then would you describe this person at the time of your sponsorship? Were they also a mentor to you? Why or why not?

170
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.365
Bodhi: Don't think they they were a mentor. Certainly someBodhi that I that didn't look up to that, that they still aspire to to be like. But from a mentoring perspective, probably not close, but but not in a mentorship capacity.

172
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.840
Amanda Sargent: And do you still have a relationship with this person? And if so, what does it look like?

173
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:57.397
Bodhi: I do. It looks it's evolved. It means still part of her organization. I'm happy to. I'm happy to be here. It it affords me a lot of opportunity, and it mean the relationship is is just grown, and I'm very happy to to still have have that relationship and still be part of the organization.

177
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:18.850
Amanda Sargent: Okay, and you've already touched on this a little bit. But if there are others, what kinds of emotions has this person sponsorship brought up for you?

178
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.110
Bodhi: Humility, certainly facets of of humbleness, but but in that in that same light also a renowned belief. So as it sounds kind of awkward,  and eradication of self-deprecation.

184
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.540
Amanda Sargent: Hmm.

185
00:14:46.897 --> 00:14:49.570
Bodhi: That's that's really been something that that I've I've struggled with. And and this is really put that into perspective. Certainly does not make me move to the other side of the spectrum, which is, which is both full, boastful. Excuse me, and self centered, but certainly more self aware. Recognizing, you know, that the talents that I do have, how they can help to drive things forward throughout the organization and hopefully drive others as well to bring their best, and to continue to develop out and learn.

190
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.260
Amanda Sargent: Netherlands. So we're also interested in how holding different identities, different social identities can influence, how people experience when, in what ways they experience and understand sponsorship. So I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions now about how your social identities race gender, sexual orientation, social class may have influenced. How you think about or experience sponsorship. So we'll go one by one, and I'll start with social class background. So do you feel that your social class background has influenced in any way, whether or how you have experienced sponsorship in general.

193
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.370
Bodhi: Yes.

194
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.290
Amanda Sargent: Great. Can you explain a little bit of of how.

195
00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.930
Bodhi: I would. White, we'll say, running the cusp of middle upper class. I think I'm, I think, that that afford you a certain or imprints upon you a certain mindset of of sponsorship. Hmm! I would like to say, I would like to think that that is consistent across sex race, creed background. Unfortunately, I don't believe that to be the case at all. I was, I was. I had the benefit of that.

205
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.210
Amanda Sargent: Interesting. So kind of elaborating on that then you use. I would also like to believe that it's offered equally to all people regardless of identity. We know that that can sometimes not be the case. How do you feel like your gender and or sexual orientation identities have or have not influenced, whether and how you experience sponsorship.

208
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.889
Bodhi: I certainly fit into the the norm which I I don't like to use that that term, but that's just the fact. Right. I am a white male has a college background. I think that that affords me sponsorship opportunities that many others don't. I think also that plus where I sit. You know, in in terms of my my life. Right? Being married with 2 kids that are older, less more self, sufficient, less reliant, certainly helps as well.

219
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.440
Amanda Sargent:  So, how do you think so? Thinking back to the the example that you gave of the person that sponsored you? How do you think, or do you think at all, that any similarities or differences in your social identities may have influenced? How, in what way, and whether this person sponsored you.

223
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.920
Bodhi: No, I don't know. I mean her being a female, I think. Coming from that same background. I I don't know if it was I? I don't know if that entered into the equation.

228
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:24.850
Amanda Sargent: And then what kinds of sponsorship behaviors do you think are most important for people who share similar identities to you?

229
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.499
Bodhi: I would like to think that a an embracing of diversity is is is important for sponsorship, and I would like to think, and I do believe that similarity of background is not the most crucial factor, but rather for sponsorship, tt is a recognition of what the individual can
 Handle, can do, can influence and can change going forward. I think that's probably one of the more or most important kind of facets of sponsorship is, while the background, race, creed, sex, sexual orientation are there, It's the belief in the individual to help develop out others to grow and change things, so that diverse mindset is more commonplace. I think that that is, that

249
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:43.040
Amanda Sargent: And then what are some barriers, if any, that that people who share your identities might face in obtaining or receiving sponsorship.

250
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.450
Bodhi: I think, in obtaining. There's a fear. Your rejection. There's a fear of. Can I do this? There's a fear of how do I balance it all?

253
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.420
Amanda Sargent: Hmm. So when you say fear of rejection, you mean if someone like you were to ask someone to sponsor them, there's a fear of of initiating that contact. In the 1st place. Yes.

256
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.840
Bodhi: Think so. Yup, there, there is right, and and it has to do with just, it could be different at different organizations. I think it has to do with the hierarchy of of organizations, and how it embedded, that is, into your Geo. DNA. And culture. Are you comfortable with having that conversation with those that are 2, 3 levels above you. Certainly that has a big, big role in it.

262
00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.170
Amanda Sargent: sure, So what do you wish that people who have different identities from you would understand about your sponsorship needs and preferences.

264
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.779
Bodhi: I would like to think that it has the sponsor, if the sponsor has and it can embrace, does embrace. Excuse me, Dei. And has a high Eq. That the opportunities should be afforded to more. That being said, identifying, and being comfortable to approach a leader that embraces Dei and has a high Eq. I don't know if that is commonplace. I don't know if that's commonplace, it may be in our industry. But as you look across financial services manufacturing high tech industries. I don't know if you're going to see the embracing of those 2 core values as much as you see in healthcare.

281
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:52.440
Amanda Sargent: so it might be helpful if more people in those positions of power also reached out not just relying only on folks to ask.

282
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.300
Amanda Sargent: got you. perfect? Okay? So thinking again about the experience that you described, how did other people react to your receiving that sponsorship.

284
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.700
Bodhi: I think there was. There was an element of of certainly happiness and and and recognition. I think there was a a view of, I can do something like this, too. So I think it. There was an there was a big element of inspiration. You know, I like to think that it it has to do with with the humility of the person. Certainly it's not something that I  broadcast, or that we've broadcast or announced broadly, but it is something that I think you know, noted in in closer, intimate settings, is really helpful for others.

296
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.140
Amanda Sargent: Hmm.  To sort of see other people helping other people. Right?  Yeah, I love that, perfect. Okay. So in light of our interest in understanding how individuals experience and understand sponsorship based on different social identities. Is there anything that I should have asked you? But I didn't. And if so, what would you? What should I have asked, and what would you have said.

301
00:23:20.116 --> 00:23:23.909
Bodhi: The only other thing I would have said is, is or asked is is that person's background in terms of career progression similar to.

304
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.770
Amanda Sargent: Yeah. More. Hmm.

306
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.859
Bodhi: In terms of roles, jobs, and industries covered. I think the answer to that is is, there are certainly a lot of shared experiences.

308
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.380
Amanda Sargent: Okay.

309
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.930
Bodhi: But certainly, as you look to embrace diversity right? That that leaders recognition that someBodhi hasn't followed the same path, but and can rest in the same industry and field. I might ask that because you don't necessarily know the background of the individual that's sponsoring. But right there, there, I think it is there. It is interesting to see if there are similar traits, and what was recognized there.

314
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.614
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, no, that's great. I just wrote it down. I was like, Oh, that's a really good question. Okay, so we have a couple more minutes left, and I'm curious. Have you ever had an opportunity where you were able to sponsor someone else.

316
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.140
Bodhi: From an academic perspective?

317
00:24:35.978 --> 00:24:38.120
Amanda Sargent: More from workplace. But if you've got academic I'll.

318
00:24:38.348 --> 00:24:42.010
Bodhi: Yeah, I've had to do. Just reach out to me a few times. I've got a, a gentleman that used to be an intern and then a 1st rotation. Our leadership program, you know, certainly will continue to help sponsor him as he develops at his career. But yeah, I've been. I've been fortunate enough to to have that experience, and still do.

321
00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.969
Amanda Sargent: Okay, how similar or different was this person to you in terms of the social identities we discussed.

322
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.290
Bodhi: Very different.

323
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.079
Amanda Sargent: Really tell me more.

324
00:25:06.996 --> 00:25:10.110
Bodhi: He is from the inner city in the Bronx. He is a black man who just graduated from college.

326
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.420
Amanda Sargent: Hm.

327
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.030
Bodhi: Work through him, exiting the city, moving out to Texas, taking on.

329
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.280
Amanda Sargent: Wow.

330
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.269
Bodhi: A rotational role out there to help broaden both his view of the organization. Certainly. How he looks to develop out his career. I am very fortunate to also call him a friend.

334
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:48.689
Amanda Sargent: So what are some of the specific actions, then, that you've taken that have been that we could consider sponsorship of this individual? What are the specific behaviors that you've done.

335
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.070
Bodhi: Being an advocate on him when he doesn't know.

336
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.149
Amanda Sargent: Hmm! Oh, same work.

337
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.729
Bodhi: And an advocate about him when he doesn't know. So, having the conversation about him. With others in either hiring or developing out areas. Right? It's the conversation happens about the individual that they don't know about. That helps them to grow and ascend.

344
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.700
Amanda Sargent: So what were some of the outcomes that resulted from your sponsorship of this individual.

345
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.309
Bodhi: I like to think that that I've helped him to think about his rotational programs.

346
00:26:30.146 --> 00:26:34.310
Bodhi: And certainly as he asks questions or he interviews with others. They will immediately reach out, and I will have be on his behalf. Talk about what I've been able to see him grow into, certainly feel questions about what he wants to do. But I like to think I'm the the advocate that he sometimes doesn't know exists.

349
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.790
Amanda Sargent: Hmm! And tell me a little bit about how you made the decision to provide the sponsorship for this particular person. What made you decide. You know this is the guy I I need to support this one.

351
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.270
Bodhi: I don't know how to describe it other than sometimes you just are afforded an opportunity to meet someone, and they have a profound impact.

353
00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.580
Amanda Sargent: Hmm.

354
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.690
Bodhi: He was, he was certainly that that person. 

356
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.650
Amanda Sargent: Hmm. Amazing. Okay.

357
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:30.470
Bodhi: Almost like a a 6 cents, so to speak. You just, you know it. You may not be able to describe it yet in terms of words, charisma, dedication, communication, care. But you just know it.

362
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.420
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, and it sounds like, is he? Is he still unaware that you're doing the sponsorship form? Or is he aware of some of it?

364
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.230
Bodhi: I don't know. We don't talk about it. It's 1 of the things.

365
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.100
Amanda Sargent: So interesting.

366
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.239
Bodhi: Probably feel uncomfortable ever talking to about about him with.

367
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.420
Amanda Sargent: Oh!

368
00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.170
Bodhi: I don't know, but but I do know that that I will. I will always be an advocate on his behalf.

371
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.880
Amanda Sargent: So that's the end of the structured questions. Do you feel like there was anything across the topic of sponsorship? That I should have asked, and if so, what would that be? And how would you answer.

373
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.559
Bodhi: I I don't know if it's it was something to to ask, but you know it's more of. I think you kind of hinted on. This is that there difference between sponsorship and mentorship and the need for it throughout, right? So specific to the program it it is. It is. It is really important, because there's a lot of different stressors that you're not necessarily prepared for that. Come across your plate right? And having that sponsor that has the long term vision of you. It's really helpful. But also helpful is that mentor that can recognize in a more tactical level. You know what changes need to occur. What are the stresses that are happening? Are there things that we need to reshift to make you successful in moving towards that long term vision of that sponsor. I I think that balance is is really core. And again, I am. I am fortunate to to have that.

381
00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.570
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Alright. Well, then, I'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording.

382
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.120
Bodhi: Thanks.

383
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.930
Amanda Sargent: We should get a little message here.

BODHI
