00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.405
Amanda Sargent: Message that says we're recording. perfect. And then, just for the record, could you confirm that you are here of your own volition? We have not coerced you in any way to participate in this interview, and you're willing to have your responses recorded in the research.

3
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.030
ANNELISE: Yes, confirm.

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.300
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Thank you. So can you just tell me a little bit about yourself, and why you wanted to talk about sponsorship today?

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.341
ANNELISE: Let's see, my name is ANNELISE. I feel like, based on my career trajectory and where I'm at, I wouldn't be here if I hadn't had support from other people in my life. I'm interested in speaking to you about that because I'm curious what you'll do with that information once it's gathered.

11
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:08.740
Amanda Sargent: Absolutely and feel free to ask any questions about that now or later. I'm always available. We really are interested in trying to help organizations do this better. But we'll talk about that in a second. We'll talk about.

12
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.080
ANNELISE: Okay.

13
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.590
Amanda Sargent: Okay, so how would you personally define career sponsorship? And do you think it's the same or different from mentorship?

14
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.700
ANNELISE: Oh. I mean, when I think of sponsorship, I think that there's a monetary value or some sort of exchange that happens, like a support, as opposed to mentorship. I find mentorship to be a little more casual and fluid, with no monetary exchange, perhaps. Is that what you think the difference is? I'm curious. Excuse me, I'm just getting my water.
 
22
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.170
Amanda Sargent: No problem. Yeah. So there's actually a really big debate. In terms of like those of us that study this stuff of like, what is it? And what is it? Not so when we think about career sponsorship, you know, from like the academic or business operations side of things, where usually people think about it in the context of a corporate environment.
we think it doesn't just happen in corporate. But that's the that's the history, right and corporate environments, and that it's it's historically been thought of as a part of mentorship. So that good mentors, for example, also sponsor whoever they're mentoring. But the debate is on the other side of that. And really where it's going, knowledge, wise like with research is that they're actually different things. They're related. But we think of them as kind of separate things. The mentorship is more the. did I freeze? No, okay. Oh, I thought the screen first.

28
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.390
ANNELISE: That's right.

29
00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.717
Amanda Sargent: Okay, we think of mentorship more as kind of the guiding, the teaching, the shepherding people,  usually like a big time commitment, too, it involves like a relationship that's sustained over time. Whereas sponsorship we think more of as specific targeted actions that one person takes on behalf of another that is specifically aimed at advancing their career. So it's possible that those things are related right? Maybe good mentors also do sponsorship, but it's also possible that they don't right, that a person may take an interest in helping someone advance their career. But they're not doing the teaching, the shepherding. They're doing other types of behaviors. And that's kind of where the study came from. We're interested in. What does that look like?Right? If they're different, then what does career sponsorship actually look like in terms of the behaviors that people do, and also who gets sponsored and who doesn't? And are there any specific requirements or barriers that people might face to getting a sponsor and keeping a sponsor based on things like social identity.

33
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.110
ANNELISE: Hmm, okay.

34
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:12.959
Amanda Sargent: Yeah. But the monetary piece has come up quite a bit, actually. Like, what we haven't seen as much in the research is people talking about how important things like financial and non-financial resources are. The focus has mostly been on social interactions. And that's probably part of it, you know, like making recommendations for people, putting people up for promotion, advocacy—that's important. But unlike what people have found in the past, especially when we're looking at people who are in different types of industries, not just in, like, Big 4 accounting firms, that there are other kinds of actions and behaviors that are also important for someone's ability to advance in their career if we don't constrain it to just that one industry and that one type of company. So I'm curious about your experiences and what you think you've you've experienced from other people sponsoring you, or if you've ever sponsored somebody else. So I'll ask a specific question to start with, and then I'm going to ask you to sort of tell me a story if you can think about a time when somebody has done this for you has demonstrated some kind of action that you feel like was instrumental to helping you advance in your career. Do you have a circumstance in mind? You think you could talk about.

38
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.690
ANNELISE: Absolutely. And also, would that include, you know, college? Like, you know, my professors providing me, like, connections to further my career as well, or...?

42
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:36.680
Amanda Sargent: Sure anything you feel like they. It was something they did, and because of that you were able to move in the direction that you were looking.

43
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.070
ANNELISE: Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:45.149
Amanda Sargent: Right, and that can be up, or it can be. It can also be lateral, right? Like, I mean, if it's, it's a different industry, for example, or but it was something that helped you advance in your personal career.

45
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.010
ANNELISE: Yes.

46
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.610
Amanda Sargent: Perfect.

47
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.520
ANNELISE: Take samples.

48
00:05:49.110 --> 00:06:02.030
Amanda Sargent: Wonderful. Okay? So I'll start with. So for one specific example, can you tell me where you were working at the time? If you were in school. That's fine as well, like, what was the organization? How big was it? And what was the industry.

49
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.850
ANNELISE: If we talk about working... like, me, I mean, I've had a lot of people sponsor me throughout my career. But one example would be, I was working at Oshkosh B'gosh, actually, with Emily, in New York City. I mean, that's a larger corporation.

55
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.550
Amanda Sargent: Industry, but I mean.

56
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.970
ANNELISE: Retail services.

57
00:06:36.453 --> 00:06:37.420
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, perfect.

58
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.099
Amanda Sargent: perfect. And what was your job? Title at the time when you were sponsored.

59
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.960
ANNELISE: Associate textile designer.

61
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.620
Amanda Sargent: Perfect and approximately. How old were you.

62
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:52.370
ANNELISE: Yes. Maybe 26 or 28. I think I was 28, yeah.


66
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.970
Amanda Sargent: Okay. And so would you consider yourself at that time to have been at the beginning of your career, or more towards the middle.

67
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.270
ANNELISE: At at the beginning. Yeah, I was about 3 years in after college.

68
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:20.189
Amanda Sargent: Okay, perfect. And tell me about this person who sponsored you. How did you perceive their social identities? Race, gender, social class, age.

69
00:07:21.893 --> 00:07:25.816
ANNELISE: So she... she was my manager at Oshkosh. Asian female, about 10 years older than me. I definitely, like, looked up to her, you know. And we... there was not, like, a a friendship. It was more, you know, a role of her being... yeah, being my manager and... so I don't know if that's enough information.

76
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:02.720
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, that's okay, perfect. Yep, perfect. Okay. So tell me the story. What did this person do to sponsor you.

77
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.660
ANNELISE: She... she acknowledged my talent and my... hardworking... I know that I'm a hard worker. And I was wanting to move. I... I was talking about moving to California, and she had a company that she had worked for in California. She gave me the contact to work for them. And, you know, during that process, I was creating a portfolio, and she would review it. And so she really went out of her way to help me move forward in my career. Yeah.

92
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:08.579
Amanda Sargent: And when you say gave you the contact, did she like facilitate an interview for you? Did she just introduce you to the hiring manager what specifically happened there.

93
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.889
ANNELISE: Yeah, she facilitated it. So yeah, for sure.

94
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.000
Amanda Sargent: Perfect, and why.

95
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.440
ANNELISE: And yeah.

96
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.179
Amanda Sargent: No, no, go ahead because she was friends with the person. Okay, perfect.

97
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:19.590
ANNELISE: Yes.

98
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:25.029
Amanda Sargent: So she kind of leveraged her relationship with this other individual to help you gain the opportunity over there.

99
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.983
ANNELISE: Yes. Yeah.

100
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:34.600
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Okay. Why do you think she chose you? Why, why did she say ANNELISE is the person that I want to put in this position, and I want to go out of my way for.

101
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:43.999
ANNELISE: Again... I... I have a very hard work ethic. I'm very talented and... and good with people. I think that's really been why I've had so many opportunities—because of those three things. Like, I... I just am kind and... like, and I am thankful. And I work well with other people. And, yeah, I think those are the main reasons why she, like, pulled me aside and gave me that opportunity.

109
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.959
Amanda Sargent: And would you consider this person at the time of your sponsorship also to be your mentor?

110
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.760
ANNELISE: Yes. Yeah.

111
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.989
Amanda Sargent: And do you still have a relationship with this person.

112
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.380
ANNELISE: I do. I'm actually... I've... I'm actually good friends with her now. But at that point in my life, it was more just her as a manager, you know, and there was, like, a separation in regards to our relationship. Sure.

117
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:47.150
Amanda Sargent: What kinds of emotions did this person's sponsorship bring up for you.

118
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.960
ANNELISE: I... I think... definitely appreciation... confidence, you know, especially during that time. I... I really didn't have confidence in my capabilities. And I... I think, you know, that is... was just huge, you know. And that's... that's one reason why I'm interested in the study, or, like, why I want to speak to it. Because throughout all of these happenstances in my career, that was, like, a big takeaway for me—is that I'm good enough. Or, if I'm not good enough at that point, I have potential to be good enough if I try hard enough. Yeah.

127
00:11:48.210 --> 00:12:15.660
Amanda Sargent: That's been in a really, I think amazing thing that we've seen as we've been talking to people kind of across the board is is that you know a lot of times we think about sponsorship, and we think about like financial outcomes of it, or, you know, concrete. And I'll ask you about that in a second. But the the not as tangible things, the personal things are coming up more and more and more, which is so fascinating. So what what other kinds of outcomes do you feel like came from this sponsorship? And it can be that concrete career stuff? It can also be other personal things.

128
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.730
ANNELISE: 
I definitely... hmm. I mean, I... I furthered my career because, you know, I had, like... having the opportunity to have a different role. And, you know, a higher level... you know, there... there's more experience that you gain from that, and that obviously makes you more valuable as a designer. It gave me the opportunity to... hmm! I mean it. It give me the opportunity to move to California, which was incredible, you know, cause they they ended up paying for for my move. The the company emotionally. I guess I I think that's it. Yeah. I I wish I'm trying to think of other stuff, but I think that's it, for now.

137
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:35.869
Amanda Sargent: That's perfect. Do you have any other examples, maybe from other areas like work or school, or other places in your life? You could tell us about a sponsorship experience.

138
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.203
ANNELISE: Oh, my God. Yeah. In school, I had a professor go out of her way to show my work to a visiting artist, and that artist ended up wanting to provide me an internship in New York City, and that... that's how I ended up moving to New York. And that professor also... I am an embroidery artist. That was kind of, like, my specialty there. And, you know, she found a sewing machine, a used sewing machine at the shop that was normally 800 bucks, and it was 350. She's like, "ANNELISE, you have to buy this." You know, and I still have it. I... I still use it. And they also get. Yeah. They they gave me opportunities in regards to like recommending me for internships, but not even that that one, but also another, another one within the school. And again, all of that was because of like hard work, you know. I mean, I've worked my my butt off And... and talent. And just genuine kindness, you know, because I think... you can be a hard worker, and you can be very talented. But if you're not good with people, I don't think that those... it's not as easy for opportunities to come your way, you know. So I think that's a really important aspect—is kindness. And yeah.

161
00:15:39.980 --> 00:16:05.149
Amanda Sargent: So I'm going to switch gears just a tiny bit. I'm going to ask you about some of your own social identities, and whether or not. You feel like they've influenced your ability to obtain sponsors or maintain sponsors, or the kind of sponsorship that you may have experienced. So I'm going to specifically ask about social class background, gender and race or ethnicity. But if there are other identities you feel like have been really important to your experiences with sponsorship. Please feel free to share those as well. We have heard
all kinds of things in these interviews. It's been really fascinating. So we'll start with social class. Do you feel like your social class background, or how you grew up, has influenced whether or how you experienced sponsorship in general? And if so, how.

163
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.120
ANNELISE: Hmm. I'm just thinking about it. I mean, I I grew up middle class. I I think. I yeah, I I don't. I don't fully know. I mean, I think, like some opportunities were given to me because no, I I'm I'm sorry I I can't speak to that. I I don't know why I'm having a hard time thinking about that one.

169
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:22.490
Amanda Sargent: That's okay, I mean, and sometimes it doesn't. So if it doesn't, it doesn't. And that's okay. What about gender? Do you feel like your gender identity, has influenced your experiences with sponsorship.

170
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.649
ANNELISE: Yeah, I mean, all, all of the opportunities primarily were from other women. And I think that you know there, there's a connection there in regards to like, you know, women helping women progress, you know. yeah.

175
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:56.750
Amanda Sargent: Yeah. So that's super interesting, because it's not even just about the identity of the person getting sponsored. But we're hearing a lot about sort of demographic similarity can be important in these types of relationships as well. Yeah. what about race or ethnicity? Do you feel like your racial identity or ethnic identity has influenced in any way how you've experienced career sponsorship.

177
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.290
ANNELISE: No, I mean. I, I understand, like being white and being middle class, that does that has afforded me opportunities. So okay, so maybe. Yes, that is afforded me opportunities that other people of color probably that wouldn't have, you know, because I, because of coming from a middle class, I I took out loans for college, but at the same time, you know, I had opportunity where my parents, you know, helped me with my phone bill helped me with. you know my apartment in. I think that there's something to having the like more resources that allows for you to experience more things and be connected to more people. who can possibly sponsor you. I'm sorry. I'm like not speaking very well.

188
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.559
Amanda Sargent: No, I that makes total sense. No, that sounds like it. I totally get it. So thinking about your constellation of identities, right? Because we're all multiple things, all at the same time. Do you feel like there are any specific kinds of barriers that people who might share your identities have to obtaining or maintaining sponsorship? And if so, what might those barriers be.

190
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:52.699
ANNELISE: I mean no, I... I... I find that, like, if... if you want it, you can get it, you know. So I... I don't... I believe that there's opportunity, if you, at least for me personally, if you work hard enough and put yourself out there. So.

193
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.440
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. And then are there any types of sponsorship behaviors that people who might share any of your identities would need more than people who maybe have different identities. And if so, what would those types of behaviors be.

195
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.389
ANNELISE: Say that question one more time.

196
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.519
Amanda Sargent: I'm gonna rephrase it. So thinking about yourself and and I'll do, I'll use myself an example. So one of my identities that's like, really salient for me is being a woman. That's probably.

199
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.510
ANNELISE: The most.

200
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:45.329
Amanda Sargent: Salient identity for me most of the time, and I work in the business field so it tends to be male dominated. There are certain types of actions that I feel like, as a woman, I need more from a sponsor than maybe my male counterpart. So, for example, I really need allyship. I need especially people who are men to speak up for me and get me into rooms that I might otherwise be shut out of because my networks are primarily women. That's, like, a behavior I really wish more specifically men in high-powered positions would do to sponsor me, to move higher in my career. So, and there's other. There's probably others, too, right? But so I'm curious for you in your field, thinking about your different identities. Are there any specific kinds of sponsorship behaviors that you wish you had, or you feel like you need more because of an identity group that you belong to.

205
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.520
ANNELISE: I agree with the, like, being a woman. I think there is a... we're... I think we're taught to make ourselves small. And I see that with other women in... in my industry, or just other women, like, interacting, navigating the world. And I think that... that aspect, in terms of, like, being sponsored and being given more resources when, like, you know, standing up for yourself, being more vocal, you know... yeah, I... I think that. And then also just requesting, you know, what you're owed. Like, maybe requesting a decent salary. Again, I think it's very common for women to, you know, request less. yeah.

222
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.230
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. And then, are there any identities that I didn't ask about? But you feel have been influential or important to your ability to obtain or maintain sponsorship, and if so, what would those be.

224
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:18.800
ANNELISE: No.

225
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.689
Amanda Sargent: And then have you ever had the opportunity to sponsor someone else? And if so, what was that like.

226
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.890
ANNELISE: I've... I've had... I've had a coworker. Yes, I've... I've given... I've helped people obtain jobs, and other females obtain jobs. And one was through my college. Someone posting, I don't know, like, a... an alumni who just graduated. I think someone reached out that she was looking for a job, and that she was very talented. And she ended up moving from... oh, wow! I've had... I've... I've had... I've gotten, like, three different women jobs that I didn't know at all, that were all young and graduates. And it... it felt really good, obviously, because I... I love helping people. And I think, again, like, people like having opportunity to... to see the potential in themselves and providing resources that they otherwise may not have, you know, yet. Especially being, you know, a young kid out of college. You don't have any contacts. Maybe your mom knows... yeah, well, you know, if... whatever, you have a family member in the industry. But so that's... that felt really good, you know, that I could move... move that forward in terms of, like, paying it forward from the person who mentored me, you know.

242
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:26.719
Amanda Sargent: And why did you decide to sponsor these specific people? You said you didn't know them already. So what was it about these folks that made them worthy of this extra time and effort.

243
00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:36.720
ANNELISE: Their portfolios were very good, all of them. I spoke over the phone with... or I met... met with for coffee. And I... again, if... and the people who connected me to them, just, if they have to be hard workers. If someone isn't, like, doesn't have grit and isn't willing to work hard, I'm not going to put my effort towards... towards that. And all of these... these three women that I helped were very talented and very hard workers, and very kind, you know. So.

249
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:20.809
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. Okay, so that's the end of the scripted questions. But I always ask folks at the end of these. Is there anything that I didn't ask about, but I should have. What else do we need to know about career sponsorship from your perspective?

250
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.420
ANNELISE: Well... I'd be interested in, like, if... if there were programs, or, like, I'm just curious how there can be more of this in the world, you know. I... I love that there is a fluidity to it, you know, and it... there isn't, like... sometimes it's... it's not, you know, the structured thing. It's just like, "Oh, I... I know, like, I've worked with you, and I think you're great. So let me help you." But how we can facilitate more of this in the world.
And I think providing resources for mentees to take more action to gain these opportunities, you know. That there are... there's so... there's so much out there. If you really, you know, reach out to people, you know. So I... I think, like, that as a younger person, I wasn't... I didn't realize, like, how... how many resources there are out there. If I really, like, just, you know, just emailed p... you know, emailed everyone, you know. I mean, even now, like, when... like, I recently was... I... I was freelancing for a long time, and there's a point where I didn't have any work. And I went on LinkedIn, and... or no, I... I was just thinking of this one company that I love, and I just, like, reached out on LinkedIn to the... the design director. And, you know, and there... she ended up responding, which usually people don't do that. But I... I think, like, no... like, having that internal compass where you're like, "Oh, I... I can do this if I try hard enough, or if I reach out." Oh, yeah. perfect.
