1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.870
Amanda Sargent: And you should see a little notification that says that we're.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.660
BEN: Yeah. Gotcha.

4
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.050
Amanda Sargent: Awesome. Okay? So as we get started, just to confirm you are here voluntarily, and you do agree to have your responses included in this research.

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.170
BEN: Yes. I agree.

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.779
Amanda Sargent: Thank you. So can you tell me just a little bit about yourself, and why you volunteered to talk to us about sponsorship today?

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.920
BEN: My name is Ben Buckley. I'm from Brooklyn New York. I have been in the entertainment space in terms of work in Korea for about like maybe 1516 years. Working in all this different facets. So of radio and video production and casting and on camera in front of camera behind camera all aspects of production. I I think I wanted to to do this just to learn a little bit more about sorry if you hear motorcycles one just learning a little bit more about the differences between sponsorship and mentorship and just be able to like hopefully sell some of my experience so that I could. Oh yeah.

23
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.529
Amanda Sargent: Perfect. I love it.

24
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.010
BEN: And that card that that $50 gift card.

25
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.190
Amanda Sargent: I mean, that's what.

26
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.840
BEN: Me!

27
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.490
Amanda Sargent: Right, and you'll get it right after this. I will literally send it to you like the moment that we're done with this video. Okay, so talk to me a little bit about how you understand sponsorship. If you had to describe it to somebody else, how would you define it?

29
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.619
BEN: Well I I can say like honestly prior before we had a conversation I specifically thought about sponsorship in the way of somebody sponsoring somebody for from another country you know. So I'm thinking about that kind of sponsorship. And not in a sense of advancement outside of the scope or outside of a room that you know somebody's not in. And the advocation that kind of comes from that learning more about that I would just say that. I think sponsorship is being able to help somebody that might not have the advantages that somebody else has. Help them by, whether it's by vocal or written advocation or whatever kind of advocation so that they can maybe break through the ceilings of gender race sexual orientation whatever the isms are and to help them kind of grow.

37
00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:22.090
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, no, that's perfect. I think there's a lot of overlap like, probably. Why, the term is the same across the way you were understanding it in the way that we're talking about it in a career context is because it does require a person who is in some kind of position of power to like voucher leverage, that power right for someone else to get something they desire. So that that makes total sense. And then, as you're learning more about it. Do you feel like sponsorship and mentorship are the same? We talked earlier about how some people don't. Sometimes they.

38
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.470
BEN: Evening.

39
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.200
Amanda Sargent: They're different. Sometimes I think they're the same. But what do you think.

40
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.389
BEN: I I think they are. I think they can intersect. I think they can be the same in some instances. For instance I've had mentors that I built work relationships with. So they started out just work relationships and then kind of built towards mentorship. And then they were able to sponsor me in in in certain ways of advancements. But I've also been in spaces where maybe we're colleagues. But maybe I don't have the access that this particular colleague has. And they have done some sponsorship for me in terms of advocation in places that maybe I wasn't privy to. I just wasn't looking or or had my eye on so I can see how they intersect. But I do think that you probably don't have to be a so a mentor to be a sponsor and vice versa.

48
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:55.999
Amanda Sargent: Perfect perfect. So then, just for the context of this study, we're really loosely defining sponsorship. We're saying, it's basically any concrete behavior or a set of behaviors that one person does on behalf of another, one to that's important to, or specifically targeting advancement of, that other person's career. So he, hearing that definition, can you think of a time when somebody may have sponsored you.

49
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.416
BEN: For sure. sorry about that. Okay, I I would. I would say, it actually happened to me last year I was in alright, we're redacted alright. So I used to work for a company called [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY] and while I was there I worked for [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY]s, black vertical cocoa butter. But I also did some work for [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY] video and then a person that worked on the [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY] video side and kinda started to help him become integrated into cocoa butter side. Once we got like, you know, we started making more viral things, and we started to get, you know. Build the audience. I started working closely with her. I left the company in 2020 and then probably 2022, 2023, while I was working 2022, while I was working at Conde, Nas. That particular a woman happened to also get a job at Conde. Nas after me. I work for [MEDIA/MAGAZINE ORG] and she was like the Vice President of video for [FASHION ORGANIZATION]. And my manager, direct manager was also working at the [FASHION ORGANIZATION] team as well. And so you know, I'm just we we met up, you know. I told her, like, you know, you know. Give me let me know if you need anything, or you know, give me, you know. Let's just stay in contact. I'm glad you're here all these things. But like a few months later that woman reached out directly to my manager and asked if I could be a video director for the met gala in 2023. So last year and I don't think it's uncommon to pull people from other teams. But I know that this person specifically asked for me. Based off of my working connection that I had at [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY] now at Conde now, so I could. I could say that that there was somebody who again I I not that I would say the verticals. Everybody is very dedicated to their own vertical. So there! I don't want to say segregation, but like people usually don't walk walk across like the each other's like space unless absolutely needed to. I could say that that definitely put me in a different place because it wasn't only my manager who was put on notice, but also other teams and other, you know, from other companies that was, it was able to help make a transition for me that I didn't even see coming. So I think that's a good example of just not being in a room, but having somebody advocate on my behalf in a sponsorship ship situation.

68
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.039
Amanda Sargent: I bet that was an amazing opportunity, too. That's so cool.

69
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:28.912
BEN: It really it really was. It was it was a great opportunity. But then like it was an opportunity that didn't age well because of the talent who who it was. It was good in 2023 but they're not doing so good at 2024. I'll just say that. And but I nevertheless proud but also asterisk.

71
00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.345
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, right? Got you.

72
00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:43.729
BEN: But I will say it opened it, opened the opportunities for me to work across other verticals.

73
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.280
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, yeah.

74
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:44.920
BEN: Yeah.

75
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.390
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, no, that's amazing. I just want to clarify a couple of things about your relationship to this person. So work together at a different organization.

77
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.110
BEN: Work together.

78
00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:03.580
Amanda Sargent: And then you came to a new organization. But you were there first, st and then they came, and they were in a Vp role. So technically a higher level position than what your position was. And then how so you said this person was a woman? Did you have other identities you perceived for this person like what was their, you know, potential, like race or ethnicities.

80
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.670
BEN: Oh, wow!

81
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.610
Amanda Sargent: And.

82
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.672
BEN: I would say so. Probably around my age early to mid thirties. White Australian woman white woman I mean, I use Vp of the [FASHION ORGANIZATION], I would say that, you know, there's some upper blast there. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah.

87
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.728
Amanda Sargent: Got it. Amazing? Okay, so what specific outcomes do you think were the most important that came from this and that this can be career wise. You talked about a couple, but it can also be important.

89
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.210
BEN: Important.

90
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.980
Amanda Sargent: And all.

91
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.646
BEN: I think Well, I'll I mean I'll say this like I didn't expect to go to Conde Nest. It wasn't like on my on my radar cause I worked in specifically, even though I was at [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY] like my my whole career up until that point have been primarily black focus in terms of content creation. Once I got to Conde, Nas. It kind of opened up a a lot more, I would say in in terms of diversity and projects and and and just like, just in general, just working alongside colleagues and just everything. I would say that. Probably the biggest you asked me the biggest difference. Right? I'm I'm sorry.

99
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.250
Amanda Sargent: Outcomes you think were most important.

100
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:45.610
BEN: Outcome.

101
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.710
Amanda Sargent: From this person sponsoring you? Yeah.

102
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:53.760
BEN: Oh, okay, so I would say, the outcomes. I I think I think it helped build credibility with with just that just being able to ask for me by name. Also shows that like and this this happened a few times at this company is just kind of like meeting people who I never expected to meet or bump into that I might have known from somebody else. And then, just like I I think it helped just solidify more of my reputation. Not only at Conde Nest, but like the branches that extend outside of it from previous things. So from what people had told people. There have been situations where people like. You know, I know we have a friend in common, such and such. They told me wonderful things about you so I think just like it's cliche. But I think it helped continue to make my reputation speak for me without people, you know. People might not have known. But then you got somebody like the Vp of video for [FASHION ORGANIZATION] being like, well, we know Jamir is skillful. And we we would like him on this shoot specifically. So I think I think things like that. Continue to help put me in places that again. Otherwise I wouldn't be looking for, because this job wasn't on my radar and while I'm grateful to have it I think that along with my hard work. A lot. Has that helped? Has been like reputation oriented. Yeah. So yeah, I would say that.

113
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.731
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, no, that makes total sense. do you think that? So one of the other pieces that we're interested here in this particular research is about how people's different identities influence their experience with sponsorship. And you said that the person who sponsored you in this particular instance was white and a woman and Australian. And that's several identities that are actually different than the ones that you hold. Do you feel like, does it matter if you have similar or different identities from someone who sponsors you. Does that influence? How people decide to sponsor just what are your thoughts on similarities?

115
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.809
BEN: I'm sorry. Hold on. Let me just I'm finishing up all right. Sorry. Can you just ask me that question one more time?

117
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:22.949
Amanda Sargent: Yeah. So no, no, you're fine. So do you think that being similar to somebody who might be there to sponsor you? Right, does it influence people's decisions to sponsor or people's experiences with sponsorship? If you're more similar or different from your sponsor.

119
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:49.570
BEN: I mean, I'll be honest. I've had. I've had. I've I've been fortunate enough to kind of get the the, the gamut of sponsorship in some ways in different facets of my career. I will say that specifically what I had noticed throughout my media career was that it was a overwhelming amount of black women that had, provided mentorship and sponsorship in certain regards. That have helped me move through my career. But there had also been white men some, and and some white women specifically that had also helped me in facets, too. I'm alive. I'm also a live storyteller. I I do like live storytelling around the the country. I specifically like was working with them. I've been working with the moth. I don't know if you're familiar with the moth, but just in terms like a storytelling platform. I was not. Didn't know what story. Live storytelling was as a profession. I took a class and then kind of fell into the moth but once I started to like really be able to tell my stories, and I think I I started to see. Probably I mean, I saw black women advocating, but I saw white women advocating to just you know in in in ways of you know. Hey, Jamia, I heard, or I saw what you did on XY. And Z. I'd love for you to tell your story in Kansas City, or I would love for you to host this storytelling show. I I'm hosting one to to tomorrow night, actually. And I think a lot of that just comes from at, you know advocation but I've I've I've been privy enough to kind of see it on through a lot of different spectrums. I can't say which one has like. If I've seen a greater impact of one versus the other. They're all kind of connected. I would say specifically, just woman based women have helped me the most throughout my career. But, I don't know, may I? I would I would say. I I mean, I don't know the lasting effects, and probably is still going through certain things. I don't know like what it'll look like a few years down the line. But I can say, probably I can't say bigger. I could just probably say, different, different. Yeah.

139
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.159
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, no, that that makes sense. Okay. So now, I'm gonna ask you to think about the different identities that you hold. And I'm gonna ask about 3 specific facets. But there people have brought up all different kinds of identities in these interviews that whether we ask about them or not, so if there's something that seems really important like, please just like, go ahead and say that. So we're gonna start with asking about how you identify in terms of gender, social class and race or ethnicity. And if you feel like any of those identities influence or have influenced how you experience sponsorship. So why don't we start with social class backgrounds. Do you feel like your social class background? Has had any influence on the way that you experience sponsorship.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.210
BEN: Okay.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.439
Amanda Sargent: Okay, we're all set. Okay, so are you cool to jump back in.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.420
BEN: Oh, yeah. Sorry.

5
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:17.619
Amanda Sargent: No problem. Okay? So the question that I was starting with was, Do you feel that your social class background has influenced whether or how you've experienced sponsorship, and if so, how.

6
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.770
BEN: Okay? So from the we're talking about race, class, and gender, right? Okay? So I consider myself black. Yeah, black. And in class. So I was. I was thinking about this based off of because you sent me the questionnaire prior. Based off of class, I would say, I probably grew up like middle upper class and then gender I'm cisgender heterosexual man.
And how do I think that any of this played a part in sponsorship. Yeah, I'm sure I'm I'm sure. Even if it wasn't told to me. I I probably think that there were opportunities where people were like. Well, we could sponsor jameir he could give like a black point of view or black representation. And things like this. It doesn't. It doesn't go like I'm not ignorant to the fact that that's a strong possibility. I don't look at it as like the only possibility. But has it probably gotten me in the door in some instances? For sure, for sure. I think being just a black man, there's so many different connotations. And then so many people who want to be advocates for whatever the reason is. So I'm not ignorant of the fact that that could have been a possibility or most likely were possibilities in some instances. Yeah. I think it definitely plays a part.

30
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.329
Amanda Sargent: What about gender identity? Specifically anything specific to being a man.

31
00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:26.559
BEN: In terms of sponsorship, you know, maybe there were opportunities where somebody—I can't think of one specific, but I know there have been opportunities where there were situations like, "Hey, Jamir, you know, I recommended you for X, Y, and Z, because we need more men," or, "You know, we're looking for a black man perspective. So I want to know, would you be interested in X, Y, and Z?" so yes, I I think, in that lens. But I haven't got any opportunity like. Hey. you're a man. you know. It's it's more, it's more so of like we kind of need represent. We're looking for representation in this specific lane. Could you be a part, or could you recommend somebody.

41
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:32.560
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, I think that's super interesting. And I'm wondering if it's if it's something to do with Field cause I I interview a lot of people that are in corporate America, and I think no one would say that
like in a corporation if you went up to somebody and said, I need. I want you to have this opportunity because you're a black man. I think that would not fly in a corporate setting.

44
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.030
BEN: No.

45
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.600
Amanda Sargent: So what's what's different about entertainment?

46
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.510
BEN: Well, I think certain—what I'm specifically saying, those instances have come about maybe had to do with mentorship, speaking engagement. There were these things, or like panel representation, where, like, you know, somebody specifically is looking for maybe a panel of black men who work in a specific field, have a certain education level. So nobody in corporate America was like, "Hey, we need a black man just to be on this project," even though I do think some of the video opportunities in terms of filming had come because it was like, maybe it would be more comfortable because this talent is black or a minority if there was a black and/or minority director. Not that it was told to me, but do I think that that might have been something in the back of somebody's mind? Absolutely.


54
00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.679
Amanda Sargent: No, no, that definitely makes sense. And obviously you're very good at what you do, because people wouldn't be recommending you for things if you.

55
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.340
BEN: Yeah, like, yeah, yeah, really, like. Sometimes, I'm really shocked. I'm like, Oh, sure one. Okay, sure. Why not?

58
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.890
Amanda Sargent: Why not? I love.

59
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.610
BEN: Guys

60
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:27.670
Amanda Sargent: Okay. So thinking about the different constellation of identities that you bring? Are are there any that I didn't ask about that you think are important for thinking about either access to or barriers to sponsorship, and if so, what would those be.

61
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:49.559
BEN: No, I mean, those are probably the main ones. Cause, oh, I think all the other ones, like I said, were probably based off of some kind of foundation of work, of dependability, or reliability that somebody was like, "Okay, yeah, Jamir, can—" you know, "I would recommend Jamir for this because he's good with X, Y, and Z." those will probably be it, I think, in the entertainment industry is less about like cause. I was, gonna I was thinking about. I know there's probably access of, like somebody who's a college graduate. But I think, being more the the more years I put into my my in my field, the less that that you know matters, unless it's very specific. Yeah.

69
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:37.480
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, no, that makes sense. So then, thinking about the different identities that you hold, do you feel like there are any sponsorship behaviors that are more important for people who are like you and share your identities.

70
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.359
BEN: Sponsorship behavior. Can you give me an example.

71
00:06:43.240 --> 00:07:00.750
Amanda Sargent: Yeah. So I mean, some of the things people have come up with have been so you said, for example, advocacy, right? So advocating for someone to get a role or a promotion or more compensation. We've had people who have said sharing like secret knowledge, like helping you understand organizational politics that you wouldn't get.

72
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.450
BEN: Unless this person.

73
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:28.370
Amanda Sargent: Decided to share it. We've had what else? Recommending for opportunities. So I mean advocacy for a promotion is one thing, but like connecting to an opportunity that you wouldn't normally have, or giving an opportunity that you wouldn't normally have. We're curious if there are any groups that feel like, you know, they don't have as much access to certain of those behaviors, or if they could really really use certain ones like more because of the identity groups. They belong to.

74
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.430
BEN: Yeah, okay, okay. So it's basically like if somebody was in my position—okay. I would say—I'm trying to think, you're asking me really good questions, because these are things that I kind of have glanced over, thought about. Because, of course, I'm like, well, clearly somebody's advocated for me in certain spaces. I would say, it's not—I'm not lost on the fact that there is a certain outlook or societal impression. Specifically, I mean, at least, I was taught—I can't speak for everybody else, but black people have to work twice as hard to be just as good. I don't know if you've heard that. My mom also is in the education space. The more she grew, the more she became one of the only people in the room. And so the access and information, for in her specific field, she was able to get because she was on the other side of a very strong and uphill barrier. I think, in my specific field, even though it was a black woman who recommended me for my job at Conde Nest, and like helped get me in in the door. I sometimes I look around and go. I I wouldn't be privy to a lot of the information unless I unless I was here. It's very rare space. So I think that if there's somebody in my position, what I would say in terms of sponsorship is—don’t necessarily wait. I don't know, I just think information should be a little more easy to gain about organizational leadership, and you know, just certain tips and tricks and life hacks that I've learned in this space that I probably—and career hacks that I wouldn't necessarily have if I wasn’t here. Here,  do a a program called the Conde Future at [MEDIA/MAGAZINE ORG]. It’s in like its second year. I was a mentor for the students in the pilot program. And the students who came in were diverse, mostly black and brown, though, from all five boroughs in New York. But it's not lost on me that once these teens come in, they're awarded with a lot of access. I mean, they're awarded with, you know, internship, and you know, PA. Opportunities like the kids last year got a chance to to work at the met gala, too. They were like all all over the place, working in the met gala and I'd say the met gala is indoor be all. But I know there's a lot of privilege just being in the space like Conde Naz, because I am also in a space like Conde, Nas and I recognize that there aren't a lot of people that look like me. And while I'm may not be giving all, given all the information, there's definitely a lot of information career, wise and industry wise that I probably would not have or not have learned if I wasn't in this specific place. So that isn't lost on me. I do think information should be more available, and opportunities should be more available. Because it's like, you know, what about the teenagers that didn't make it to the program? What about the other black people who didn't get the job? But I found myself coming out with knowledge of production, or just like a work mindset that other people don't have, so I make it my business to try to share as much as I can.

121
00:12:08.469 --> 00:12:21.049
BEN: Because I know that that probably wouldn't happen if if you know, if there wasn't, if if I wasn't a vessel of all that information and just didn't decide to share it. You know, cause people don’t—people don’t...
Yeah, I hope that I hope that answers.

125
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.630
Amanda Sargent: It does.

126
00:12:29.886 --> 00:12:30.400
BEN: Your question.

127
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:43.619
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, yeah, that was great. I mean, in kind of going going forward with this. I mean you. You spoke a little bit, or alluded a little bit to this, too. Do you feel like there are certain barriers to sponsorship that people who share certain of your identities might face, and if so, what would those be.

128
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.230
BEN: Come on. Yeah, for sure. Inclusion, racism—I mean, and maybe not, "You're black, I exclude you," but it's the systems. It's the systems at play. So there is—if I wasn't—alright, so going back to just the [FASHION ORGANIZATION] example, if I wasn't at the place I was at, which was [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY], there wasn't a one-on-one connection where this person saw or heard from other people that I had done X, Y, and Z, and that things were progressing in whatever field. When we met back up, there would be no advocation. And I'd say, even if I did a good job, it's not guaranteed sponsorship. Like, I think it was—and unbeknownst to me—maybe going above and beyond to the point where somebody goes, "Okay, I remember this person." And you left so much of an impression of me, of your work, that I have to advocate for you. 



146
00:13:58.828 --> 00:14:02.870
BEN: I'm not—I—let me not say I'm not sure. The experiences that I've seen, working within the company, and not just my company, but [SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY] too, is that if you're white, you could—because it's who you know more so in the business—you could be very mediocre, lackluster, not go above and beyond, but still be afforded a lot of the same opportunities. Now, I'm not saying that I would get them without hard work, having to not settle for mediocrity, having to really go above and beyond. Not saying that that's the case all the time. But I've seen it.
I've seen it, yeah, for sure. Signed.

155
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.170
Amanda Sargent: No, 100%. And I think we have a lot of research, too, that shows that that's true, right? That, like, it's a lot easier for white people to be not very impressive, but still have access, right? And because also, we have—so, I mean, the concentration of people in power across many organizations, especially like high-powered financial institutions, tends also to be white, right? And we know that people hang out with people who look like them, that they also may be more likely to share that power or to do that sponsorship for people who also look like them, right? Regardless of performance and things like that. So, I mean, I think everything that you said makes so much sense, and is also just like depressing, but at the same time—

161
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.250
BEN: Yeah.

162
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.299
Amanda Sargent: I totally hear it, and it makes a lot of sense. Yeah.
Let's see. That was a really good answer, like a little moved by what you said, so I'm I lost my place, so hold on.

166
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.770
BEN: Oh, I.

167
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:46.160
Amanda Sargent: Yeah.

168
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.050
BEN: Yeah, it's just, you know, I think being in this space has taught me a lot of lessons that I probably wouldn't have learned, which has made me more confident. So as a person in this space, because it's just like, I'm just gonna do me.

172
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.340
Amanda Sargent: Yeah.

173
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.070
BEN: I'm good enough, and I know I'm smart enough, and it's not that. These are just systems that don't benefit me.

175
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.780
Amanda Sargent: Yeah.

176
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.710
BEN: Cognizant like. I'm not asleep on that. So.

177
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.179
Amanda Sargent: Right. Yup. Absolutely. How have other people responded or reacted to your being sponsored by others?

179
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.378
BEN: Like other people—should like, with the same—that would be... we're talking about other, like, people in the same kind of identifiers as me, or just in general?

182
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:51.460
Amanda Sargent: Just anybody anybody who saw. Oh, this person really advocated for BEN, or this person really like put Jamir up like, what have their reactions been to those.

183
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.438
BEN: You know, I actually, I would say, in some situations—I don't want to say people have been like... I don't want to say, like, more excited than I was, but I think there have been people, for instance, like we had a reorg at [MEDIA/MAGAZINE ORG], and so I was working across a few brands. Now I work specifically with [MEDIA/MAGAZINE ORG], so we report directly to [MEDIA/MAGAZINE ORG]’s team. And the editor, I think, the editor-in-chief of [MAGAZINE], or something—I forgot his title, but he's like, maybe right under the editor-in-chief. He worked with somebody on a show that I—we have a mutual acquaintance. He worked with somebody on a show that I worked with. When him and I had a one-on-one, we spoke about my experience and then found out we had a mutual. And after like that meeting  he kind of went back to like my manager, and was just like, you know. I like BEN. I've heard I I know people that he's worked with have heard none but good things about him would love to see him more integrated in, in, in, in, in the space outside of just being a video director. Um, so like my manager came back and she told me this information. And I was just like, Oh, wow! Like I I was surprised. And she was like, “this is amazing. This is like, really. And I'm like”. yeah, yeah. I, I think I reacted like that because one out of shock too.
 I don't necessarily talk a lot about myself or my career, or the things that I have done, but I'm I'm aware of the things that I planted. And so when things happen like this, I'm usually like surprised. But I'm not shocked at at the fact that there are people that that are ad like with advocation for me?  Just because, like. I know the kind of work I do.
It's just very like confident. And even when I don't do a good job like I own up to things. So I think just like professionalism. The professionalism working in corporate America and entertainment space, thus far has been learning lessons. And I've built such a foundation that like. When people do this, it's more like a wow. Thank you, and less of like a Oh, my, gosh, it's just yeah. It's like, well, this is what I've been putting in the work for planting the seeds for. So I'm glad that people, you know, do advocate, but I find that there have been a lot of people who are like very enthused. But then there are a lot of people—and this comes from all races and demographics—who, in different ways, have maybe shown envy, or, you know, make passive-aggressive statements, microaggressions, these things. And I catch a lot of them. And I also understand that, like, you know, we're all human, so envy and jealousy, these things. And I I catch a lot of them. And I also understand that, like, you know, we're all human, so envy and jealousy those things come up. But I I see I see that, too, when when there is advancement, or I wish I could be like you or you doing your thing, and you know I'm not doing my thing, and I've seen all those things come at at like, at the result of sponsorship or sponsorship opportunity sometimes. Yeah.

228
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:55.499
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, well, it's interesting. You're right. It's it's human. But at the same time.

229
00:20:56.943 --> 00:21:04.360
BEN: Yeah, it does it. It does like i i i i i move differently. Of course, like, sometimes I just might be reluctant to tell people certain things.

231
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:08.910
Amanda Sargent: Sure.

232
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.328
BEN: After experiences like that, but also understand that you know, a lot of that has nothing to do with me and more… Some of it could have specifically to do with me, but I think a lot of it is just because people might not be where they want to be, or.

236
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.020
Amanda Sargent: Sure.

237
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:36.899
BEN: I see that opportunity as being diminishing. I've I've gone through that. So I understand. So like, I'm not holier than thou. But yeah, I I recognize that as well.

238
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:56.439
Amanda Sargent: Yeah, yeah, sure. Well, so that's the end of the scripted questions. I always just ask everybody at the end. Is there anything that I didn't ask, or something that you feel like about this topic. People really should know this. So you want to put something else on the record. Anything else we should know about sponsorship.

239
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.450
BEN: i i i i can't speak for anybody else, but I would say sponsorship—and well, both sponsorship and mentorship—are very important to me, because I would not be where I am now without sponsorship and advocation. Like, I just—I just wouldn’t be. And so, I think I make it my business to reach back and to help provide opportunities because opportunities were provided to me. And that's how I—that's me personally how I measure how a lot of success for me is measured. Of course, it's individual strides and goals and achievements, but the power to help put people in positions where they just wouldn’t be—whether that be women or Black people and other people of color or genders—I see value in that. I see value in that, because there were spaces where—I experienced spaces where I was the only one on the set, or like, one of the only ones, or one of the only people with power as a director on a set. And it really, really, really—I went through, like, an identity crisis because I was like the only one. And I started to question whether I was good enough to be here. I didn’t speak the language. And not that it was—it was just foreign to me, because, like, being in a space that I wasn’t—I haven’t normally been in. So it took me a while to kind of build confidence. And while I see certain things like that were necessary for my growth, I also want to do my part to make it easier for somebody else who, like, looks like me, or doesn’t look like me but is also ostracized or barricaded by parameters that they can’t get through. So I think it’s imperative for me to use sponsorship and mentorship in ways that also benefited me and still benefit me as I continue to work my way in this career.

278
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.900
Amanda Sargent: Amazing. We've heard that from other people, too, this sort of like trickle down thing that once you're sponsored, you know, you want to give back right.

280
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.260
BEN: Yeah.

281
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.070
Amanda Sargent: Amazing yeah.

282
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.350
BEN: That's necessary for me, too.

283
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.720
Amanda Sargent: Amazing. Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and turn the recording off for us.
